        <H2>AN IDEAL HUSBAND</H2>
        <h3>_Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_</H3>
            
            <p><H6>LORD GORING _</H6>is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his
                pockets_.  _He is looking rather bored_.]</P>
                
                <H6>LORD GORING.</H6> <P>[_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the
                bell_.] </P> It is a great nuisance.  I can’t find any one in this house to
                talk to.  And I am full of interesting information.  I feel like the
                latest edition of something or other.

                [_Enter servant_.]
                
                <H6>JAMES.</H6>  <p>Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.</p>
                
                <H6>LORD GORING.</H6>  <p>Lady Chiltern not down yet?</p>
                
                <H6>haMES.</H6> <p>Her ladyship has not yet left her room.  Miss Chiltern has just
                    come in from riding.</p> 
                
                <H6>LORD GORING.</H6> <P> [_To himself_.]</P> <p> Ah! that is something.</p>
                
                <H6>JAMES.</H6> <p>Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
                    Robert.  I told him your lordship was here.</p> 
                
                <H6>LORD GORING.</H6> <p> Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?</p>
                
                <H6>JAMES.</H6>  <p>[_Bowing_.]</p> <p>I shall do so, my lord.</p> 
                
                <p>[_Exit servant_.]</p>
                
                <H6>LORD GORING.</H6> <p>Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
                    It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.  I hope to goodness
                    he won’t come up.  Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the
                    only proper basis for family life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are
                    darlings.</p> <p>[_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and
                    begins to read it_.]</p>
                
                <p>[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]</p>
                
                <H6>LORD CAVERSHAM</H6>  <p>Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
                    as usual, I suppose?</p>
                
                <H6>LORD GORING.</H6><p>[_Throws down paper and rises_.]</p> <p> My dear father, when one
                pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
                one’s own.</p>
                
               <H6>LORD CAVERSHAM</H6> <p>Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
                last night?</p> 
                
                <H6>LORD GORING.</H6> <p>I have been thinking about nothing else.</p> 
                
                <H6>LORD CAVERSHAM</H6> <p>Engaged to be married yet?</p> 
                
                <H6>LORD GORING.</H6> <p>[_Genially_.]</p>  <p>Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.</p>
