        <H2>AN IDEAL HUSBAND</H2>
        
        <h3>_Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House_</H3>
        <p style="white-space: pre"></p>
            
        <H6 class="name LORD GORING _" > LORD GORING _</H6>is standing by the fireplace with his hands in his  pockets_.  _He is looking rather bored_.]</P>
               
       <H6 class="name LORD GORING _" >LORD GORING_.</H6> <P class="stage_directions">[_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the
        bell_.] </P> <p class="speech">It is a great nuisance.  I can’t find any one in this house to  talk to.  And I am full of interesting
        information.  I feel like the  latest edition of something or other.</p>
      
        <H6 class="JAMES">JAMES.</H6>  <p class="speech">Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.</p>     

        <H6 class="name LORD GORING _">LORD GORING.</H6>  <p class="speech">Lady Chiltern not down yet?</p>

        <H6 class="JAMES">JAMES.</H6> <p class="speech">Her ladyship has not yet left her room.  Miss Chiltern has just
        come in from riding.</p> 

        <H6 class="name LORD GORING _" >LORD GORING.</H6> <P class="stage_directions"> [_To himself_.]</P> <p class="speech"> Ah! that is something.</p>
                
        <H6 class="JAMES">JAMES.</H6> <p class="stage_directions">Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
         Robert.  I told him your lordship was here.</p>      
                
       <H6 class="name LORD GORING _">LORD GORING.</H6> <p class="speech"> Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?</p>
                
       <H6 class="JAMES">JAMES.</H6>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Bowing_.]</p> <p class="speech">I shall do so, my lord.</p>  <p class="stage_directions">[_Exit servant_.]</p>
        
       <H6 class="name LORD GORING _">LORD GORING.</H6> <p class="speech">Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
        It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.  I hope to goodness he won’t come up.  Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the
        only proper basis for family life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are darlings.</p> <p class="stage_directions">[_Throws himself down into a chair
        _, _picks up a paper and begins to read it_.]</p>
        
        <p class="stage_directions">[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]</p>
        
        <H6 class="name LORD CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</H6>  <p class="speech">Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
        as usual, I suppose?</p>
            
        <H6 class="name LORD GORING _">LORD GORING.</H6><p  class="stage_directions">[_Throws down paper and rises_.]</p> <p class="speech"> My dear father, when one
        pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not  one’s own.</p>
                  
        <H6 class="nameLORD CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</H6> <p class="speech">Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about  last night?</p> 
       
        <H6 class="name LORD GORING _">LORD GORING.</H6> <p class="speech">I have been thinking about nothing else.</p> 
                
        <H6 class="nameLORD CAVERSHAM">LORD CAVERSHAM</H6> <p class="speech">Engaged to be married yet?</p> 
       
        <H6 class="name LORD GORING _" >LORD GORING.</H6> <p class="stage_directions">[_Genially_.]</p>  <p class="speech">Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.</p>
